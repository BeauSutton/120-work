# Final Proposal

For my final I want to go back and make one of my older projects better. Including new elements of coding that we have been learning for the past few weeks. Before I begin I need to go back and look through the modules and reread the book to sharpen my skills. I plan to do spend this week honing my skills and next week actually doing the final; giving myself until the 4th to finish it.
