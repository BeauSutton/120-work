# Week 12 Response

This week was easier than last weeks. Extra practice is always a good thing I guess. Working more with objects and now with how they can interact with one another was interesting and enjoyable. I didn't have any major problems this week besides the program crashing thanks to very minor errors in the code. Didn't get a chance to help anyone either. The other students are like vultures; first come first serve when it comes to the issues board.
