# Week 8 Readme

This week was moderately easy, as in, no real problems like the ones i've been having the past weeks. However, these types of loops seem much more skill based instead of just rewriting every line of code to accomplish the same goal. I have nothing wrong with it, it's just that I need to still improve my skills with understanding variables and certain actions. Luckily, I had no substantial problems with this weeks homework, unlike last week, and it seems as if everyone has the same opinion because I don't think I received any emails about students needing help.

Furthermore, I'm going to explore more about these loops over the weekend. I've been neglecting my reading from the textbook so this weekend will be a good time to get caught up and hone my skills.
