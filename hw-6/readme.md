# Week 6 Response

This week was difficult! However, not surprising since I can barely solve simple problems involving money or cents. Obviously, I went through this weeks module to learn how to do the homework, but this week I actually had to read extensively on the reference page to figure out how the new functions worked. Usually I understand it just by looking at the examples or Dr. Musick's explanations. But this weeks math related functions scrambled my brain and confused me to the point where half the time I spent on the assignment was just reading and practicing them.

To solidify this weeks work I am going to go over them all again and read out of the textbook to get a much better understanding and perhaps try and test myself. I didn't feel that asking others for help on my problems really seemed prudent. Thus, I made no use of the issues page. However, in regards to others problems, I am going to try and respond to other's issues quickly because whenever I see a problem some kid has already solved it for them. And so I never get a chance to try and help since I can't be on my phone all day waiting for an email from someone with a problem.
