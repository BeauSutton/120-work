# Week 10 Response

This week was pretty easy in my opinion. Not to many difficult topics and no crazy new additions. I went back to my assignment for hw-5 and added some shapes to it that would spin around and change colors. Very few problems this week, mostly concerning arrays. Just worked to add new functions into the old homework and that was basically it.

However, I will say that I need to work on understanding arrays better. They seemed so simple a week ago, but now that I actually had to do it they are harder than I expected. Seems that everyone is killin' in this class because I never see any problems that I can help with. usually one problem a week and it's solved within seconds of being posted.
