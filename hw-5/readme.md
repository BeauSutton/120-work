# Week 5 Response

I tried my best this week to try and make something really cool because animation is one of my favorite things to do. However, I kept on getting stuck and failing a lot with this weeks material. I continuously became more and more confused as I went on in the module. Each time a new thing would pop up the more confused I became. And that confusion led to frustration in my homework for this week and it didn't come out the way I had hoped. However, I plan on re-working this weeks material over the next coming days while I read the assigned chapters.

I was able to fix a lot of the issues I initially had by going back and redoing a lot of the examples until I was finally able to do it on my own.

I tried to help a student who was having a problem opening her HTML.index file. However, her problem was that her browser wasn't up-to-date.
