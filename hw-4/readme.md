# Week 4 Response

This week was extremely exciting, I was becoming concerned as to when we would get into the meat of the class and finally make something using p5.js. Before I started the assignment I made sure to save a link for all the help pages. For example, I would save the reference page for how to create an arc or triangle. Then, while I was working I would go back to those pages and learn how to incorporate them into my drawing. I didn't have any serious problems this week. However, shortly after starting I couldn't get figure out how strokes worked because I had wrote it out as strokeweight without a capital W instead of strokeWeight with a capital W. Which at the beginning concerned me greatly because it deleted my whole drawing until I fixed it.

Nothing in particular piqued my interest this week. However, that is to be expected because this week was, in a sense, just applying skills we all learned last week.

I feel like a never get a chance to respond to people's issues because I never have time to work on this class until Wednesday or Thursday night. Thus, i'm always the last guy to the party and all the issues have already been resolved. I'll make a note to myself to start this class Friday night perhaps. That way i'll be the first to respond to people's issues and get those points.
