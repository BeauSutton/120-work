# final Response

The final was a pretty difficult process for me because I couldn't decide on how I wanted it done. There were an infinite supply of ways to do it but I could just never decide. I knew I wanted to model it off of one of my older projects since I didn't feel confident enough in my own ability to make my own game or other type of media. I had practiced for a week before I tackled the final, however, I don't think it did much good. I ended up making multiple different finals over 3 weeks and I never felt proud or accomplished with them in anyway. I would just delete them and then start over again the next day. All in all the final was difficult and I am most certainly interested in learning more and continuing on my own over the summer.
