# Week 11 Response

This week was pretty difficult. I didn't really understand the whole concept of classes or how they could be combined with arrays. I really liked the bubbles example and wanted to expand on it because I think it was a little boring. Needed a little something to make it more interesting. However, in regards to actually problems I had, I can't say I had specific problems. My issues were more with how everything worked together. It's kind of funny, I sarcastically said last week that everyone must be doing really well in the class because not many people asked for help. However, this week, if I am correct, I don't think anyone posted in the issues section. Or at least I got no emails about it. Overall, good week. Kind of difficult but nothing to extreme.
