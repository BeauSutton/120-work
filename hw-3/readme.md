# Week 3 Response

This week was quite crazy for me so I had to do the course work the day before it is due, which I never like doing because it causes a whole bunch of undo stress to come over me. However, doing the course work was quite enjoyable! It was actually really fun writing out the code and seeing the effects take play within the html browser file.

I really didn't have any problems with this weeks homework. Which i'm really glad for because when I was attempting to learn java script I always ran into problems and had to go back and forth for hours trying to correct the smallest mistakes in my code.

one thing I do have on my mind, however, is how does j5 know what functions do what things? Like, could I create my own function out of thin air and manually assemble some sort of thing with it? Or is it all decided and can I not create any specific functions?
